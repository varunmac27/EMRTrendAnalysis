### Trend analysis to increase EMR presence

- Researched and performed feature selection of 3000 variables of National Institute of Health Trends Survey to cluster 18 variables into buckets based on Technology Assessment Model.
- Obtained inductive inferences from univariate and bivariate descriptive statistics. Generated plots to test hypothesis.
- Applied statistical methods such as Principal Component Assessment and Factor Analysis. 
- Measured performance of the multivariate logistic regression model formed based on predictions on test data.
